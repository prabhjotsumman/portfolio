            <p>
              As a Developer, I truly enjoy bridging the gap between design and
              engineering â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye
              for design to build a beautiful product. I derive great
              satisfaction from building better, more efficient code as well as
              working in details and designs of the product to achieve superb
              UX/UI.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>When I'm not coding,</span> I will most likely be playing
              video games, basketball, snowboarding, working-out or watching
              Netflix.
